location: "College Park, U.S."
excerpt: "I led a weekly lab session, where I help my students: <br>
<ul>
    <li>Review lectures,</li>
    <li>Demonstrate building analog circuits,</li>
    <li>Grade students' experiment reports and exams,</li>
    <li>Hold office-hour Q&A.</li>
</ul>
My class had the highest average score in the final exam among all 7 classes, and they surpassed the second place for about 10 points! I'm so proud of them!"
