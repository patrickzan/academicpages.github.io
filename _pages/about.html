<h2>Bio</h2>
Hello! Welcome to my personal webpage! I am currently a Principal Data Scientist at <a href="https://www.originwirelessai.com" style="text-decoration: none">Origin Wireless AI</a>, founded by <a href="http://www.cspl.umd.edu/kjrliu/" style="text-decoration: none">Prof. K.J. Ray Liu</a>, the <a href="https://www.ieee.org/about/corporate/election/index.html" style="text-decoration: none">current IEEE president</a>. I work with the Algorithm team at Origin, and my work includes wirelss sensing research, machine learning algorithm development and engineering implementations.

I obtained my Ph.D. and M.Sc. degrees in Electrical Engineering from University of Maryland, College Park both in 2019, and my B.Sc. degree in Electrical Engineering from Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China in 2014. My Ph.D. research focuses on neural signal processing and auditory neuroscience supervised by <a href="https://ece.umd.edu/clark/faculty/481/Jonathan-Simon" style="text-decoration: none">Prof. Jonathan Z. Simon</a>. I am a signal processing engineer and an auditory neuroscientist by Ph.D. training, but I have sufficient expertise in computer science and data science to have fun both in work and at home.
